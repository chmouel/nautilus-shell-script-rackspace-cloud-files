zenity
GNU sed
GNU tar

Install
======

- Place the script somwhere like in your personal bin directory like
  ${HOME}/bin or anywhere you feel.

- Create a link to the nautilus scripts directory :

  cd ${HOME}/bin #adjust the path if you have placed it somewhere else
  ln -s $PWD/nautilus-rackspace-cloud-files.sh ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/Upload\ to\ Rackspace\ Cloud

Now you should have a menu scripts/Upload To Rackspace Cloud when you
right click on a file (or select multiple files) in nautilus.

If one of the file is a directory it will make tar gzip tarball and upload it.

If you have the package xclip installed available in Debians or from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/ and your container is public it will automatically shorten the full public URL and copy to your clipboard.

Note

This has been developed on a fairly recent debian sid feel free to let me know if it does not work with your distro.
